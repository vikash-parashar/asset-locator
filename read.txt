User
is it possible to make request to an external server from my golang app , and when the connection is establised then run a cmd cmd to get data 

like i.e..  

Local Host - Where tool is installed.

Local Host -> Request -> Server  - As request sucessfuly gets established

Solaris / Linux

SSH (22) / RDP (3389)

echo |format - Disk
hostname  - server name



is it possible ?

if possible how to implement into my golang web app

Yes, it is definitely possible to make requests to an external server from your Golang web application and run a command on that server once the connection is established. In your case, it seems like you want to establish a connection to a remote server (Solaris/Linux) using SSH and then run specific commands.

You can achieve this in Golang using packages such as golang.org/x/crypto/ssh for SSH connections. Here's a simplified example:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Replace these with your own values
	server := "your-server-address"
	port := 22
	user := "your-ssh-username"
	password := "your-ssh-password"

	// Establish an SSH connection
	client, err := ssh.Dial("tcp", fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", server, port), &ssh.ClientConfig{
		User: user,
		Auth: []ssh.AuthMethod{
			ssh.Password(password),
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to dial: %s", err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Run a command on the remote server
	session, err := client.NewSession()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create session: %s", err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Example command: "echo | format - Disk"
	cmd := "echo | format - Disk"
	output, err := session.CombinedOutput(cmd)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to run command: %s", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Command output:", string(output))
}
This is a basic example, and you might need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, note that using a password for SSH authentication in production is generally not recommended. Instead, consider using key-based authentication.

In a web application, you might want to trigger this functionality in response to a specific HTTP request. You can use a web framework like Gorilla Mux or Echo to handle HTTP requests and integrate the SSH functionality as needed. Here's a very basic example using Gorilla Mux:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"net/http"
)

func handleSSHRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Your SSH connection and command execution logic here

	fmt.Fprintln(w, "SSH command executed successfully")
}

func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/run-ssh-command", handleSSHRequest).Methods("GET")

	http.Handle("/", r)

	// Replace "your-listening-address" and "your-listening-port" with your desired values
	http.ListenAndServe("your-listening-address:your-listening-port", nil)
}
This is a basic example, and you'll need to adapt it to fit the structure and requirements of your web application. Additionally, consider adding proper error handling, security measures, and using a more sophisticated framework if your application becomes more complex.
